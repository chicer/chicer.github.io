		<p>Creating beautifully functioning web based applications and online storefronts for costumers is my passion. Computers are like a second language to me and I have been interested in programming since I was given my first Macintosh in 3rd grade.</p>

    <p>I thrive off of collaborating on projects with others and helping achieve a better outcome as a team.</p>

    <p>When I am away from the computer you will find me making music or trading altcoins on Coinbase.</p>
